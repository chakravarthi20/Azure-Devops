# ✅ Terraform Basic
### What is Terraform?
- Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, GCP) and even on-premise systems.
- Instead of manually creating servers, databases, and networks using cloud consoles, you write configuration files that automate this process.

**Key Points About Terraform:**
- Declarative Language: You describe what you want (e.g., "I want 2 VMs in Azure"), and Terraform figures out how to create it.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Your infrastructure setup is written in code (.tf files), making it version-controlled, shareable, and reusable.
- Provider-based: Terraform uses providers (like Azure, AWS, GCP) to interact with different cloud services.
- State Management: Terraform maintains a state file (terraform.tfstate) to track resources it manages. This enables Terraform to know the current infrastructure status.

**Why Use Terraform?**
| Benefit | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Automation** | No manual creation of resources; everything is automated |
| **Consistency** | Same code can deploy identical infrastructure in Dev, QA, and Prod |
| **Version Control** | Infrastructure code is stored in Git, like application code |
| **Multi-Cloud Support** | Single tool for AWS, Azure, GCP, and others |
| **Collaboration** | Teams can collaborate on infrastructure development like coding projects |

# ✅ Prerequisites for Terraform Setup with Azure
### 🧰 Step 1: Install Azure CLI
Download Azure CLI from the official site: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
After installing, verify the version:
az --version

### 🧰 Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/
Launch VS Code after installing.

### 🧩 Step 3: Install HashiCorp Terraform Extension in VS Code
- Go to the Extensions tab (🔌 icon)
- Search for "HashiCorp Terraform" and install it.
This extension provides syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Terraform files – making writing .tf scripts easier and error-free.

### 🗂 Step 5: Extract and Set Terraform Path
- Create a folder C:\Terraform.
- Unzip the downloaded Terraform file into this folder.

### ⚙️ Step 6: Set Environment Variable (PATH)
Go to: Control Panel > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables
Under System Variables, select Path → click Edit → click New → add:
C:\Terraform

### 🧪 Step 7: Verify Terraform Installation
Open any terminal (Command Prompt, Git Bash, PowerShell).
Run:
terraform --version

### 🔐 Step 8: Log in to Azure
From the terminal, navigate to:
- cd C:\Terraform -> az login
It will open a browser to authenticate and show your Azure subscriptions. ✅ As seen in pic 6, you're successfully logged into your Azure account and ready to run Terraform scripts on Azure resources.
