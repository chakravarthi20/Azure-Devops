### Step 1: SSH Key Generation and Add to Azure DevOps
On the Docker VM, I want to clone a repo and push that, for that we need to have access permission to devops from our docker VM, So I created an SSH keypair using:
- ssh-keygen -t rsa
- Public key (id_rsa.pub) was copied and added to Azure DevOps ‚Üí User Settings ‚Üí SSH Public Keys.

This setup allows passwordless secure Git clone operation from Azure DevOps into the VM.

### Step 2: Clone ASP.NET Repo from Azure DevOps 
We went to our Azure DevOps repo, selected SSH instead of HTTPS, and copied the SSH URL.
- On Docker VM: git clone git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/ChakravarthiSangoj/Testing/asp-net-webapp
Successfully cloned the repo without any username/password because SSH was already configured.

### Step 3: Navigate to Web App Project 
Moved into the folder structure until .csproj file (azdevsecops-webapp.csproj) became visible.
This is important because the .csproj defines the ASP.NET Core project.

### Step 4: Create a Dockerfile
Inside the project folder, we created a Dockerfile with this content:
**Command to Create a file with name Dockerfile : vi Dockerfile**
```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build-env
WORKDIR /App
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet restore
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0
WORKDIR /App
COPY --from=build-env /App/out .
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS http://*:5000
EXPOSE 5000
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "az-devsecops-webapp.dll"]
```
**Explanation Line-by-Line:**
- FROM sdk: Set up the SDK environment for building code.
- WORKDIR: Create a working directory /App.
- COPY . ./: Copy the code inside the container.
- RUN dotnet restore: Restore the project dependencies.
- RUN dotnet publish: Build the release version output into /out folder.
- FROM runtime image: Create a smaller runtime container using aspnet.
- COPY --from: Copy build output only.
- ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS: App listens on port 5000.
- EXPOSE 5000: Open port 5000 inside the container.
- ENTRYPOINT: Start the app with dotnet run command.

### Step 5: Build and Run the Docker Container 
Commands executed:
```
sudo docker build . -t webapp
sudo docker run -d -p 80:5000 webapp
```
- docker build: Created an image named webapp.
- docker run: Mapped host 80 to container 5000, app is accessible at the VM's IP address.

Open browser ‚Üí http://VM_IP ‚Üí We saw "Welcome to DevSecOps Course" web page. (Success!)

## üê≥ Docker Registry and Azure Container Registry (ACR)
### Step 6: What is Docker Registry? 
- A Docker Registry is a centralized place where Docker images are stored, versioned, and distributed.
- Instead of manually copying images from one machine to another, we push images into a registry, and then pull them wherever needed (production, testing, cloud, etc.).
- It acts like a code repository, but for Docker Images.

**Popular Docker Registries:**
- Docker Hub (Public and Private Repositories)
- Amazon ECR (AWS Elastic Container Registry)
- Azure ACR (Azure Container Registry)

### Step 7: Create Azure Container Registry (ACR) 
To create a docker registry and push the images into it, Go to Azure portal, searched for Container Registries ‚Üí Create.
Gave registry name like devopsdockerregistry under resource group devops.

### Step 8: Authenticate and Tag Image (Pic 8)
To connect the created ACR in portal.azure to our docker VM, we use Azure CLI (If not familar, go back to my files), To install it use command: curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash, Later
```
sudo az login
sudo az acr login --name devopsdockerregistry
sudo docker tag webapp devopsdockerregistry.azurecr.io/netapp
sudo docker push devopsdockerregistry.azurecr.io/netapp
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5944c845-c87c-4464-9e4e-3f70c9631419)

**Explanation:**
- az login: Authenticate with Azure account.
- az acr login: Login Docker CLI with ACR registry.
- docker tag: Tagging the local webapp image to push to ACR under netapp repo.
- docker push: Uploaded the image to Azure registry.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc9c8987-22d2-4dd9-95a8-8bdbea4972d1)

### Step 9: Confirm Push in Azure Portal 
After pushing, under Azure Portal ‚Üí Container Registries ‚Üí Repositories, we saw a new repo called netapp with latest tag.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4b18349-aac2-49e4-9288-fa1dc97507e0)
Now we have our code in the public registry, we can push / pull from anywhere. 


## üì¶ Docker Compose
**Not Important**
### Step 10: Docker Compose Concept
Docker Compose Concept: Docker Compose allows you to define multiple containers in one YAML file and manage them together easily.
**Syntax Explained:**
```
services:
  app:
    image: webapp
    ports:
      - 0.0.0.0:8080:5000

  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - 0.0.0.0:80:80
    volumes:
      - /home/devopsmela/nginx:/usr/share/nginx/html
```
- app service: Runs webapp image, maps port 8080 (external) ‚Üí 5000 (internal).
- web service: Runs nginx container, maps port 80 ‚Üí 80, and mounts local files into container's /usr/share/nginx/html.

Command to start everything: sudo docker compose up -d
- up -d: Spin up all services in detached mode (background).

## ‚úÖ Summary of this Entire Practical:
- Connected Docker VM with Azure DevOps using SSH keys, cloned ASP.NET project, created a Dockerfile, built and deployed a containerized app.
- Created Azure Container Registry, logged in from VM, tagged and pushed the Docker image successfully to ACR.
- Learned and practiced Docker Compose, defined multi-container setup (app + nginx) easily with YAML configuration.
