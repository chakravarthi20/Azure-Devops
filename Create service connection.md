# üõ† How to Create a Service Connection in Azure DevOps

### Step 1: Navigate to Service Connections
You are in the Azure DevOps Portal ‚Üí Your Project Settings -> Under Pipelines -> click on Service connections.

This opens the existing connections list and the option to create a new one.

üìù Azure Resource Manager is the correct choice for deploying resources like App Services, VMs, etc., from DevOps.

### Step 3: Filter for Azure Options
Filtered the list by typing azure in the search box to narrow down the connection types.
- Selected Azure Resource Manager again and clicked Next.
  
üìå This prepares the wizard to set up a connection with your Azure subscription.
-  we need some details such as subscription id, tenat id, client id as below.
-  To get all these details, from here we will switch to azure portal

### Step 4: Registering App in Azure AD
Now switch to the Azure Portal.
- Go to Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
- Click on "New registration" to create a new app to authenticate your service connection.
üîê This app acts as a bridge to let Azure DevOps authenticate securely to Azure resources.

### Step 5: Filling App Registration Form
- Enter the app name something as az-devops.
- Selected Single tenant (this org only).
- Left the Redirect URI blank (optional).
Click Register to finish.

This registration gives you access to: Client ID, Tenant ID. These will be used to configure the service connection in DevOps.

### Step 6: Creating a Client Secret

Clicked New client secret, added description and expiry (e.g. 90 days), and clicked Add.

üîë You now have a secret value (copy it immediately ‚Äî it's only shown once) to complete the DevOps connection setup.
